This PowerShell script, OldUserLookup.ps1, serves the purpose of identifying inactive user accounts in Active Directory (AD) based on their last logon timestamp.

This one does exactly what is says on the tin. It searches AD for user accounts that haven't logged on to the system in a certain number of days (you can set the number of days by changing the $age variable in the script) and outputs everything to a neat CSV file. Because since when does HR tell you about EVERY leaver?
